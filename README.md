# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing **Customer Churn** behavior using interactive visualizations.
The dashboard is built to help stakeholders understand key patterns behind customer churn based on age, contract types, payment methods, and data usage.

- Total number of customers
- Number of churned customers
- Churn rate (percentage of customers who left)
- Demographic analysis (age-based)
- Contract and payment type impact
- Regional churn distribution
- Influence of data and international charges
